# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most precedence.

# When someone opens a pull request that only modifies files in directory, only
# component owners and not the global owner(s) will be requested for a review.

# Syntax: https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/

# Use individual usernames instead of teams (like @bazelbuild/android) for
# auto-assignment to work, unless everyone in the team has write permissions to the repository.
# See https://github.community/t5/How-to-use-Git-and-GitHub/CODEOWNERS-works-with-users-but-not-teams/td-p/4986
